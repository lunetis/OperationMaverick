* This is a personal project and currently in development.
* Since I'm testing with DualShock 4 (PlayStation 4 Controller), I'm not sure if other gamepads are working properly in this project. (XBOX Controller, etc.)
* Due to asset's license issue, commit histories can be deleted sometimes. (In that case, commit count will be very low.)
* Please check [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/lunetis/AceCombatZERO/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for other used assets.

### Note: Resolving missing prefab error

![](https://github.com/lunetis/AceCombatZERO/blob/main/missingerror.PNG)

If you open the project when Blender is not installed, .blend files may cause missing prefab errors.

To resolve this, you have to install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), and reimport all assets.

After installing Blender, go to Unity Editor Menu - Assets - Reimport All.

<br>

If you have installed blender before you open the project first time, no error occurs.
